% The third final problem addressed on Coursera's MATLAB course. The goal was to create a function that was able to generate an echo from the input sound file "y" (a column vector)
% with a specific amplitude ("amp") and a specific delay ("delay"), to later merge them together creating the "output" file where it was possible to listen to the input file and 
% its echo. "Fs" indicates the sampling frequency of the sounds and it usually is a default value from MATLAB sound files.

function output = echo_gen(y, Fs, delay, amp)
rows_before_echo = Fs*delay;
ind = zeros(size(y,1), size(y,2));
ind_echo = zeros(round(rows_before_echo), 1);
echo = ind;
for ii = 1:length(y)
    echo(ii, 1) = echo(ii,1) + y(ii,1)*amp;
end
echo = [ind_echo; echo];
y = [y; ind_echo];
output = y + echo;
for iii = 1:length(output)
    if output(iii,1) > 1
        scale_int = max(output);
        output = output/scale_int;
    end
end

% The function echo_of_echo is another possibility it occurred to me during the completion of the assignment where the echo from the echo can be listened too, making the sound 
% more natural than what the initial assignment specified.

function output = echo_of_echo(y, Fs, delay, amp)
rows_before_echo = Fs*delay;
ind = zeros(size(y,1), size(y,2));
ind_echo = zeros(rows_before_echo, 1);
output = [y; ind_echo];
for ii = 1:length(y)
    output(ii + rows_before_echo,1) = output(ii + rows_before_echo,1) + output(ii,1)*amp;
end
end
