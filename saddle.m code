% The first final problem addressed on Coursera's MATLAB course. The goal was to create a function able to identify the saddle points in a given "M" array and add them to 
% a new output array called "indices". Thus, it was possible to plot the matrix and mark the saddle points in red.

function indices = saddle(M)
positions = zeros(1,2);
[row , col] = size(M);
n = 1;
for ii = 1:row
    for jj = 1:col
        if ((M(ii,jj)) >= (max(M(ii,:)))) && ((M(ii,jj)) <= (min(M(:,jj))))
            positions(n,1) = ii;
            positions(n,2) = jj;
            n = n + 1;
        end
    end
end
if positions == zeros(1,2)
    positions = [];
end
indices = positions;
end
