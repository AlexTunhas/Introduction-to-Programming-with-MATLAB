% The second final problem addressed on Coursera's MATLAB course. The goal was to create a function able to pixelate a given picture from the input "w" numerical variable and 
% "img", the picture. "w" shows the size of the square matrix needed to average a single pixel from the picture to the pixels nearby.

function output = blur(img,w)
imgD = uint8(img);
[row , col] = size(imgD);
submatrix_size = 2*w+1;
output = zeros(row,col);
for ii = 1:row
    for jj = 1:col
        r1 = ii-w;
        r2 = ii+w;
        c1 = jj-w;
        c2 = jj+w;
            if r1 < 1
                r1 = 1;
            end
            if r2 > row
                r2 = row;
            end
            if c1 < 1
                c1 =1;
            end
            if c2 > col
                c2 = col;
            end
        submatrix = imgD((r1:r2),(c1:c2));
        output(ii,jj) = sum(sum(submatrix))/numel(submatrix);
    end
end
output = uint8(output);
